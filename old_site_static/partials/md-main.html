      EveKit provides access to EVE Online order book and market history data.  There are two types
      of access provided:
      <p>
      <ol>
      <li> <strong>Live:</strong> EveKit provides REST endpoints for accessing live and historical 
      market data.  Like all EveKit APIs, these endpoints are annotated with <a href="http://swagger.io">Swagger</a>
      which makes it easy to generate a client in your language of choice.
      <li> <strong>Archive:</strong> At the close of each day, EveKit archives all stored order books and market history.
      These files can be downloaded directly as described in the panel below.
      </ol>
      <p>
      The live data endpoints are best used for interactive tools where market information is retrieved
      for specific types or regions.  These endpoints are not efficient for bulk retrieval or complicated
      analysis.  For bulk downloads or analysis, archived data is more convenient to use.
            
      <h4>Live Data Access</h4>
      
      You can browse the API for live data access using the <a href="#/md/ui">Swagger UI panel</a>.
      This API is nothing more than a live version of the 
      <a href="https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/evekit-marketdata-server">EveKit MarketData Server</a>
      GitHub project.  This server is designed to work with the data collected by 
      the <a href="">EveKit MarketData</a> scraper and serves both recent data (typically, order books
      are no more than five minutes old), as well as archived data.  See the panel below for
      details on the availability and format of archived data.
      <p>
      We use this API to implement a simple <a href="#/md/book">book viewer and history browser</a>.
       
      <h4>Data Archive Process</h4>      
      
      EveKit continuously collects marketdata via CREST.  The code for this process is accessible
      in the <a href="https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/evekit-marketdata">EveKit MarketData</a>
      GitHub project.  The current deployment collects market history once a day, and order book data 
      every five minutes (the minimum cache timeout) for every region and type.  At the end of each day,
      collected data is re-assembled into a more convenient format and stored in Google's storage cloud.
      This process started at the end of May, 2016.  The available date ranges of data are:
      <p>
      <ul>
      <li>Order books for all regions and types are available from <strong>2016-05-31</strong> onward.
      <li>Market history for all regions and types is available from <strong>2015-04-01</strong> onward.
      </ul>
      
      It should be noted that market history for the current day is typically not published on CREST
      until the end of the <strong>following</strong> day.  Also, the archive process takes several hours.
      On a typical day, archived book and market history is available by 12:00 UTC.
      <p>
      Archival data is stored in a format designed to make it easy to access subsets of the data
      by market type.  However, simple tar'd and gzip'd formats are also provided for download
      and unpacking.  The panel below describes these data formats.

      <div class="panel-body col-extend">
      Archive data is stored in Google's storage cloud organized by date at the prefix: 
      <pre>
      https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/YYYY/MM/DD
      </pre>
      Market history and order book data are stored separately.  Market history uses the prefix "market" in all files.
      Order books use the prefix "interval" in all files.  Currently, order books are snapped at five minute intervals
      which corresponds to the minimum cache time for the associated CREST endpoints.  The interval snap time
      is indicated by the "5" suffix in the interval file names.  Our generation tools are capable of sampling data
      at other intervals, but currently we only provide data with five minute intervals.
      <p>      
      Three files are stored for each data type:
      <p>
      <table class="table">
      <tr><th>File Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr>
      <td><strong>market_YYYYMMDD.tgz</strong><br><strong>interval_YYYYMMDD_5.tgz</strong></td>
      <td>Downloadable archive of daily market history or order books.  Files include data for all regions on the given day.</td> 
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><strong>market_YYYYMMDD.bulk</strong><br><strong>interval_YYYYMMDD_5.bulk</strong></td>
      <td>Daily data in "bulk" form, designed to be partially retrieved via an HTTP "range" request.  This format is intended to be used
      by online tools which only need a subset of data, perhaps to drive web-based tools.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td><strong>market_YYYYMMDD.index.gz</strong><br><strong>interval_YYYYMMDD_5.index.gz</strong></td>
      <td>Index file which provides offsets into the "bulk" files based on EVE market type.  This file is read first to determine
      the appropriate byte offset for a "range" request to the bulk files.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      
      <h4>Download File Format</h4>
      
      The first file type in the table above is designed to be downloaded for offline use.  These files are tar'd and gzip'd archives of
      market data organized by EVE market type:
      <p>
      <table class="table">
      <tr><th>File Name</th><th>Entry Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr>
      <td>market_YYYYMMDD.tgz</td>
      <td>market_TYPE_YYYYMMDD.history.gz</td>
      <td>Market history for the given type and day across all regions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>interval_YYYYMMDD_5.tgz</td>
      <td>interval_TYPE_YYYYMMDD_5.book.gz</td>
      <td>All order books for the given type and day across all regions.</td>
      </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      All files store data in CSV form, but gzip'd to save space.  Market history files are typically less than 2 MB in archive form.
      Order book (interval) files are substantially larger, typically around 200 MB in archive form.
      <p>
      Market history entries contain one line per region.  Each line has the format:
      <p>
      <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>TYPE</td><td>EVE market type ID</td></tr>
      <tr><td>REGION</td><td>EVE market region ID</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ORDER COUNT</td><td>Number of market orders for this type in this region on this day</td></tr>
      <tr><td>LOW PRICE</td><td>Low trade price for this type in this region on this day</td></tr>
      <tr><td>HIGH PRICE</td><td>High trade price for this type in this region on this day</td></tr>
      <tr><td>AVERAGE PRICE</td><td>Average trade price for this type in this region on this day</td></tr>
      <tr><td>VOLUME</td><td>Daily volume for this type in this region</td></tr>
      <tr><td>DATE</td><td>History date in milliseconds UTC (since the epoch)</td></tr>
      </table>
      <p>
      Order book interval files have a more complicated format:
      <pre>
      TYPE
      SNAPSHOTS_PER_REGION
      FIRST_REGION_ID
      FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_TIME
      FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_BUY_ORDER_COUNT
      FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_SELL_ORDER_COUNT
      FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_BUY_ORDER
      ...
      FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_SELL_ORDER
      ...
      FIRST_REGION_SECOND_SNAPSHOT_TIME
      ...
      SECOND_REGION_ID
      ...
      </pre>
      The "SNAPSHOTS_PER_REGION" field indicates the number of book snapshots stored for each type and region.
      With the current default of 5 minute snapshots, this value will always be 288.  Therefore, snapshot times 
      (e.g. FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_TIME) will also be fixed, starting at 00:00 UTC and incrementing by 
      5 minute intervals to 23:55 UTC.
      <p>
      All fields are always present except for individual orders which may be missing if there are no buy
      or sell orders for a given region at a given time.
      <p>
      Each buy or sell order line is in CSV format with the following fields:
      <table class="table">
      <tr><th>Field</th><th>Description</th></tr>
      <tr><td>ORDER ID</td><td>Unique market order ID.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>BUY</td><td>"true" if this order represents a buy, "false" otherwise.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ISSUED</td><td>Order issue date in milliseconds UTC (since the epoch).</td></tr>
      <tr><td>PRICE</td><td>Order price.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>VOLUME ENTERED</td><td>Volume entered when order was created.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>MIN VOLUME</td><td>Minimum volume required for each order fill.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>VOLUME</td><td>Current remaining volume to be filled in the order.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>ORDER RANGE</td><td>Order range string.  One of "station", "solarsystem", "region" or a number representing the number of jobs allowed from the station where the order was entered.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>LOCATION ID</td><td>Location ID of station where order was entered.</td></tr>
      <tr><td>DURATION</td><td>Order duration in days.</td></tr> 
      </table>
      
      <h4>Reading Bulk Data</h4>

      Bulk data is formatted to allow easy sampling of individual market history or order book data.  Reading this data involves a two step process:
      <p>
      <ol>
      <li> Fetch the index file and find the offset of the desired type.
      <li> Use a "range" HTTP request to read the appropriate data from the bulk file.
      </ol>
      <p>
      Index files are compressed lists of pairs giving each type and the offset into the bulk file where data for that type is stored.  For example:
      <pre>
      $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2016/06/24/market_20160624.index.gz | zcat
      market_18_20160624.history.gz 0
      market_19_20160624.history.gz 1033
      market_20_20160624.history.gz 1683
      market_21_20160624.history.gz 3374
      market_22_20160624.history.gz 4089
      market_34_20160624.history.gz 4804
      market_35_20160624.history.gz 8432
      market_36_20160624.history.gz 11935
      market_37_20160624.history.gz 15258
      ...
      </pre>
      To read market history for type 34 (Tritanium), for example, we need to read data starting at offset 4804 and ending at offset
      8431 (the offset for type 35 minus one).  This can be achieved with an HTTP "range" request on the bulk file.  For example:
      <pre>
      $ curl -H "range: bytes=4804-8431" https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2016/06/24/market_20160624.bulk | zcat

      </pre>
      Interval (order book) data is accessed in a similar fashion.
      <p>
      <h5>NOTE: Market History Bulk Files with Zlib/Node.js</h5>
      Bulk files are created by concatenating gzip'd files representing data for specific types.
      In the case of market history, each row is actually a single gzip'd file.  So when reading market history
      for a given type, you are actually reading the concatenation of several individual gzip'd files.
      For standard gzip libraries this isn't a problem.  As shown in the example output above, zcat is more
      than happy to read through several concatenated gzip files.  But in Node.js with the standard ZLib
      library this isn't the case.  Zlib will stop reading after at the end of the first gzip'd buffer,
      regardless of whether the remainder of the buffer contains other gzip'd content.  If you need to work
      with the bulk files from Node.js, then you'll either need to use a different Zlib, or detect splits
      in the bulk file by looking for the gzip header magic bytes.  The latter approach is used in the 
      <a href="https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/evekit-marketdata-server">EveKit MarketData Server</a>.
      Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/evekit-marketdata-server/blob/master/api/helpers/evekit_market.js">evekit_market.js</a> for example code.
      It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to do this with interval (order book) data.  Data for each type
      in the interval files consists of a single gzip'd file.
